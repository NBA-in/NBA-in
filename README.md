# Hi there 👋

## I'm Noel — new to the coding world.

Right now, I'm learning:
- 🛠️ The basics of **Git** and **GitHub**
- 🧠 Some **C programming**, just to understand how coding really works at the core
- 📚 Planning to dive into **Data Structures and Algorithms**, along with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

I'll be uploading things I learn along the way — notes, code, or random practice files.

I'm not an expert yet, just trying to get a little better each day, one step at a time.

*Thanks for stopping by* :)
